# 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:
- Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
- The second is bring two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
- The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

> --- John Locke, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690)

### computational process/data/program:

**Computational processes** are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, process manipulate other abstract things called **data**. The evolution of a process is directly by a pattern of rules called **a program**. People create programs to direct processes.

## 1.1 The elements of Programming

> When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combing simple ideas to form complex ideas.

Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

- **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
- **means of combinations**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones.
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can ben named and manipulated as unit.
